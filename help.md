# FAQ

Here is a list of a few of these common questions with links to a solution that could be useful.

# Getting help

If you need help with shinyjs, I strongly suggest browsing the [shinyjs tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shinyjs) on StackOverflow or asking your own question there.

You can also try getting help on the [Shiny Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shiny-discuss).

If you still can't get an answer to your question, you can try [contacting me](http://deanattali.com/contact) (although because of the volume of support emails I get, I can't promise I'll be able to help). If you require advanced support, I'm also [available for consulting](http://deanattali.com/shiny/).

To report a bug or suggest improvements, please [open an issue](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues) on GitHub. 

I'd like to give special thanks to the Shiny developers, especially Joe Cheng for always answering all my Shiny questions!
