# FAQ

Here is a list of a few of these common questions with links to a solution that could be useful.

# Getting help

If you need help with shinyjs, you can try to get help from the community. I suggest browsing the [shinyjs tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shinyjs) on StackOverflow or asking your own question there. You can also try getting help on the [Shiny Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shiny-discuss).

If you still can't get an answer to your question, you can [contact me](http://deanattali.com/contact). However, because of the volume of support emails I receive, I can only provide support for a fee (as part of [my Shiny consulting](http://deanattali.com/shiny/)).

To report a bug or suggest improvements, please [open an issue](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues) on GitHub. I always strive to make shinyjs as useful and correct as possible!
